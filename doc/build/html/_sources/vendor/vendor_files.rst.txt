============
Vendor Files
============

Here is a collection of files and tools provided by DWIN for DGUS Displays. Instead of duplicating this
data into this git repository I decided to collect links here.

Basically most of the vendor stuff shown here is taken from the `CR6 Touchscreen Firmware <https://github.com/CR6Community/CR-6-touchscreen>`_

If you want to get familar with the functions of the Display I can recommend to trough `collected documents <https://github.com/CR6Community/CR-6-touchscreen/tree/extui/doc/vendor>`_
from the CR-6-touchscreen.
