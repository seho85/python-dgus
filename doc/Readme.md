Sphix Documentation Project
===========================

The documentation is generated using [Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/)

It uses the [PlantUML](https://plantuml.com/) as a [Plugin](https://github.com/sphinx-contrib/plantuml)

So for generating the documentation an executable named *plantuml* must be present in the PATH

See [Sphinx plantuml plugin](https://github.com/sphinx-contrib/plantuml) for details how this can be achieved.
